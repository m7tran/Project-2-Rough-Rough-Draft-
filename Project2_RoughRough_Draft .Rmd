Scientific Question: Is it possible that the black Perigord truffle (Tuber melanosporum) and the Chinese black truffle  (Tuber indicum) share similar protein expression profiles responsible for the production of the aromatic flavors?

Scientific Hypothesis: If the black Perigord truffle and the Chinese black truffle share similar protein expression profiles for their aromatic flavors, then volatiles and enzymes such as 2 methylbutane can be matched to the proteins obtained from these two truffles.

```{r}
library(seqinr)
T_melanosporum <- read.fasta(file = "Tuber_Melanosporum.fasta")
T_indicum <- read.fasta(file = "Tuber_Indicum.fasta")
```
